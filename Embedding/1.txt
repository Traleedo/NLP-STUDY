The novella tells the story of Santiago, an aging Cuban fisherman who has gone 84 days without catching a fish. Despite his bad luck, he remains determined and ventures far into the Gulf Stream. There, he hooks a giant marlin and struggles with it for several days, enduring physical pain and exhaustion.

Santiago eventually kills the marlin and lashes it to his boat, but on the journey back, sharks attack the carcass, devouring it piece by piece. By the time Santiago returns, only the skeleton remains. Though he has lost the fish, Santiago gains a deeper sense of dignity, endurance, and moral victory. The boy Manolin, who admires Santiago, vows to fish with him again, symbolizing hope and continuity.
